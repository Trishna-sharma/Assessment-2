            <h3 class="head-3">SUMMARY</h3>

            <p class="parax">
                I was always fascinated by computers, but I stayed away from learning anything about them for a majority of my life. This is because for
                some reason I would always encounter tech problems as a kid. From viruses to not being able to download a file, tech problems haunted
                my childhood. This lead me to have the notion that you had to be like a genius to learn computers. Even though I stayed away from
                learning anything about computers for a long time, deep down inside I wished I was good with them. Fast forward to summer 2020, I
                had no job, no classes, and wasn’t even going out due to the COVID Pandemic. I decided to finally explore my fascination with computers.
                After some research and consideration I decided to join Bathspa university. I joined the Creative Computing major from september 2021, It
                was then I realized that my passion was with coding. Fast forward to today, I am currently a junior(in 1st year) in BSU ,
                studying Creative Computing. I’m proficient in front-end web development as I know pretty well HTML, CSS,
                JAVASCRIPT, I’m also competent in C++. I’m really passionate about software
                developing and I’m currently looking summer 2022-23 internship.
